# Group 11 iW3 Project 2021

## Introduction

We are students in the 4th year of the Master. This project aims to put into practice the knowledge acquired on Docker and Git in a virtual context.

## Context

As a consultant in a Digital Services Company, we are
sent on an expert mission with two of employees (groups of 3) to implement good practices on a newly
acquired by the client company, and thus encourage the addition of new
functionalities by a team that will be put together after our visit.

## Installation

In this project, we have to work using :

Gitlab (Gitlab CI, Gitlab repository, Gitlab Boards), Github repository and Heroku issues in push to deploy.

To start the application, you need to clone the project from gitlab.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/iw-intensive-week-1-2021/groupe-11-iw3-4.git
```

Then, you need to run the docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
